# Point Reflection Problem

## Problem Description
Consider two points, $p = (p_x, p_y)$ and $q = (q_x, q_y)$. We consider the inversion or point reflection, $r = (r_x, r_y)$, of point $p$ across point $q$ to be a 180° rotation of point $p$ around $q$.

Given $n$ sets of points $p$ and $q$, find $r$ for each pair of points and print two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of $r_x$ and $r_y$ on a new line.

## Function Description
Complete the `findPoint` function in the editor below.

`findPoint` has the following parameters:

- `int px, py, qx, qy`: x and y coordinates for points $p$ and $q$

### Returns

- `int[2]`: x and y coordinates of the reflected point $r$

## Input Format
The first line contains an integer, $n$, denoting the number of sets of points.
Each of the $n$ subsequent lines contains four space-separated integers that describe the respective values of $p_x, p_y, q_x,$ and $q_y$ defining points $p = (p_x, p_y)$ and $q = (q_x, q_y)$.

## Constraints

- $1 \leq n \leq 15$
- $-100 \leq p_x, p_y, q_x, q_y \leq 100$
